# Introduction to Integrative Genomics (*gact*) {.center-title}

---

## Why Integrate Diverse Data Sources?

- Complex traits arise from **interacting molecular layers** — genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic.  
- Single data types provide only **partial insights** complex biological systems (**GWAS: DNA → disease phenotype**)  
- Integration connects **variants → genes → pathways → phenotypes** may help reveal molecular mechanisms that drive traits and diseases.
- Enables **functional interpretation**, **better prediction**, and **new discoveries** across molecular systems.

## The *gact* R Package

[**gact**](https://github.com/psoerensen/gact) provides an infrastructure for efficient processing of large-scale genomic association data, with core functions for:

- Establishing and populating a database of genomic associations  
- Downloading and processing biological databases  
- Handling and processing GWAS summary statistics  
- Linking genetic markers to genes, proteins, metabolites, and biological pathways  
- Integrates with statistical machine learning tools in the [**qgg**](https://github.com/psoerensen/qgg) R package  

[**gact**](https://github.com/psoerensen/gact) is intended to serve as **a practical implementation of integrative genomics**, bridging **statistical modeling** and **biological interpretation**, and supporting **reproducible** and **extensible** workflows.

---

## Integrating Data with *gact*

The **`gact()`** function is a single R command that creates and populates the *Genomic Association of Complex Traits (GACT)* database.  

<br>

It automates three main tasks:

- **Infrastructure creation** – sets up a structured folder-based database  
  (`glist`, `gstat`, `gsets`, `marker`, `gtex`, `download`, etc.)
- **Data acquisition** – downloads and organizes multiple biological data sources  
  (e.g., GWAS Catalog, Ensembl, GTEx, Reactome, STRING, STITCH, DGIdb)
- **Marker and feature set generation** - integrates data across sources to create
curated genomic feature sets that form the basis for the integrative genomic analyses.

<!---
Each run creates a versioned database directory (e.g. `./gactdb/`)  and returns a list object `GAlist` that tracks the database structure and files.
--->

---

## Biological Databases Used by *gact*

*gact* constructs gene and marker sets from a wide range of curated biological databases:

::: {.smaller}

- **Ensembl** — genes, transcripts, and proteins  
- **Ensembl Regulation** — regulatory genomic features  
- **GO**, **Reactome**, **KEGG** — ontology and pathway sets  
- **STRING**, **STITCH** — protein and chemical complexes  
- **DrugBank**, **ATC** — drug–gene and drug-class associations  
- **DISEASE** — disease–gene associations  
- **GTEx** — eQTL-based gene sets  
- **GWAS Catalog** — trait-associated variants and genes  
- **VEP** — functional variant annotations

*We plan to add additional biological resources in* **gact**.

:::

---

## From Database to Model Inputs

The *gact* R package includes utility functions to extract and structure data from the GACT database into analysis-ready inputs — **$\mathbf{Y}$** (e.g., summary statistic outcomes) and **$\mathbf{X}$** (genomic or biological features).

- `getMarkerStat()` — retrieve GWAS summary statistics (**Y’s**)  
- `getFeatureStat()` — extract gene-, protein-, or pathway-level results  (**Y’s**)  
- `getMarkerSets()` — define biological groupings (basis for **X’s**)  
- `designMatrix()` — build feature matrices (**X**) linking variants or genes to biological feature sets  

Together, these functions form a **reproducible workflow** for generating **standardized input data** for **Bayesian Hierarchical Models** and other **machine learning** approaches.

# Introduction to Bayesian Hierarchical Models (*qgg*) {.center-title}

---

## Bayesian Hierarchical Models

**Bayesian Hierarchical Models** provide a flexible statistical framework for modeling complex biological and healthcare data.  

They support key applications such as:

- **Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)** and **fine-mapping** of causal variants  
- **Polygenic risk scoring (PRS)** for predicting complex traits and disease risk  
- **Gene and pathway enrichment analyses** to test biological hypotheses  
- **Integrative multi-omics modeling** across the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome  

These models build directly on the **Y’s** and **X’s** generated by *gact*, providing a unified framework for integrative genomic analysis.

<!---


## The Response Matrix (or Vector) $\mathbf{Y}$

$\mathbf{Y}$ represents the **observed outcomes** or **association measures** corresponding to the features in $\mathbf{X}$.

Each **element** (or row) can represent:

- A **phenotypic value** (e.g., trait measurement, case/control status)  
- A **summary statistic** (e.g., $z$-score, $p$-value, or $\hat{\beta}$ estimate)  
- A **molecular-level signal** for a marker, gene, or protein  

In multi-trait or multi-omics contexts, $\mathbf{Y}$ can be **multivariate**, containing parallel outcomes across traits or biological layers.


---

## The Feature Matrix $\mathbf{X}$

$\mathbf{X}$ represents **molecular or genomic predictors** (e.g., genotypes, gene scores, annotations, pathway indicators).  

- Each **row** corresponds to an observation or association in $\mathbf{Y}$  
- Each **column** corresponds to a feature (e.g., SNP, gene, or pathway indicator)  

Entries may be:

- **Binary (0/1):** presence or absence  
- **Categorical (0/1/2):** genotype dosage or discrete state  
- **Continuous:** quantitative molecular values (e.g., expression, methylation)


---

## Linking $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$

Having defined our data structures (**Y** and **X**), we now link them through a linear model:

$$
\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}, \qquad
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \mathbf{I})
$$

- $\mathbf{Y}$ — observed **outcomes** such as phenotypes or molecular traits  
- $\mathbf{X}$ — **features** representing genetic, transcriptomic, or other biological layers  
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ — **effect sizes** quantifying how features in $\mathbf{X}$ explain variation in $\mathbf{Y}$  
- $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ — **residual noise** capturing unexplained variation  

This linear relationship forms the foundation for jointly modeling how genetic and molecular variation drives complex traits.

---
--->

## The Bayesian Linear Regression Model

The **Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR)** model builds:

$$
\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}, \qquad
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \mathbf{I})
$$

- $\mathbf{Y}$ represents the **observed outcomes** or **association measures** corresponding to the features in $\mathbf{X}$.
- $\mathbf{X}$ represents **molecular or genomic predictors** (e.g., genotypes, gene scores, annotations, pathway indicators).  
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ — **effect sizes** quantifying how features in $\mathbf{X}$ explain variation in $\mathbf{Y}$  
- $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ — **residual noise** capturing unexplained variation  

In the **Bayesian** formulation, each $\beta_j$ is assigned a **prior distribution** reflecting beliefs about **effect size magnitude or sparsity** and determine how **information is shared** across features or biological layers.

---

## Why Bayesian Hierarchical Models?

Regression effects can be estimated in many ways, but we focus on a **Bayesian hierarchical framework** because it:

- **Combines data and prior knowledge** to improve inference  
- Provides a **natural way to regularize** and handle noisy or high-dimensional data  
- Enables **flexible modeling** of diverse effect patterns:  
  - Many small vs. few large effects  
  - Structured effects (e.g., by pathway, gene set, or omic layer)  
- Returns **uncertainty estimates** for all parameters → improving interpretability and model comparison

Through their **hierarchical structure**, BLR models naturally **integrate multiple biological layers** — linking genomic, transcriptomic, and other molecular data  

<!---
- Performs well even when the number of features (**p**) is large  
--->

<!---

## Hyperpriors in Bayesian Modeling

The BLR model extends the linear framework by introducing **hierarchical priors** on parameters. Suppose we model regression coefficients $b_j$ with a normal prior:

$$
b_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_b^2)
$$

Here, $\sigma_b^2$ (the variance of the prior) controls how large the effects $b_j$ are expected to be. 

Instead of fixing $\sigma_b^2$ we treat it as unknown and assign it its own prior — the **hyperprior**:

$$
\sigma_b^2 \sim \text{Inv-}\chi^2(\nu, S^2)
$$

In practice, this parameter is **learned from the data** during estimation rather than fixed in advance.

--->

## Hierarchical Structure

The three levels in the model:

<div style="font-size: 0.95em">

| Level | Description | Example |
|:------|:-------------|:---------|
| **1** | Describes how data are generated given parameters | $y \sim \mathcal{N}(Xb, \sigma^2 I)$ |
| **2** | Describes our beliefs about the parameters before seeing data | $b_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_b^2)$ |
| **3** | Describes uncertainty about the prior’s parameters | $\sigma_b^2 \sim \text{Inv-}\chi^2(\nu, S^2)$ |

</div>

<br>

This hierarchical structure allows the model to learn how strongly to shrink effect estimates from the data, while accounting for uncertainty in prior parameters and automatically regularizing effect sizes.

Simple and robust, but may not capture diverse effect-size distributions.

---

## Adapting to Complex Biological Architectures

Complex traits arise from **heterogeneous effect-size distributions** — some features have large effects, many have small, and others are likely null.  To capture this diversity, the BLR framework can be extended in two ways:

- **Data-driven grouping** of molecular features:  
  The model *learns effect-size classes* from the data using a **mixture of variances** $\{\tau_k^2\}$ with probabilities $\{\pi_k\}$.

- **Biologically informed grouping** of molecular features:  
  The model uses *prior biological knowledge* to assign features to groups *a priori*, each with its own variance $\tau_g^2$ capturing within-group variability.

Both approaches enable the model to **adapt to complex genetic and molecular architectures** and **share information** across related features or omic layers  

<!---

---

## Multiple-Component BLR

A more flexible formulation assumes that effects come from a **mixture of normal distributions**:

$$
\beta_j \mid d_j = k \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau_k^2), \qquad
P(d_j = k) = \pi_k
$$

- $d_j$ is a **latent indicator variable** assigning effect $j$ to component $k$.  
- Each component $k$ has its own variance $\tau_k^2$, controlling expected effect size.  
- $\pi_k$ represents the **probability of membership** in each component.  

This structure allows the model to **capture both large and small effects**, including potential nulls.  
In practice, both $\pi_k$ and $\tau_k^2$ are **learned from the data**, making the model **data-driven and adaptive**, though not necessarily **biologically informed**.

---

## Hierarchical (Group-Structured) BLR

In this **biologically informed extension**, we assign features to predefined **groups** (e.g., genes, pathways, or protein complexes) *a priori* and model group-specific variances:

$$
\beta_j \sim \mathcal{N}\!\big(0, \tau_{g(j)}^2\big), \qquad
\tau_g^2 \sim p(\tau_g^2)
$$

- Each feature $j$ belongs to a group $g(j)$ defined before analysis.  
- Each group $g$ has its own variance $\tau_g^2$, controlling effect size variability within that group.  

This approach allows the model to **share information among related features** and **test enrichment across biological groups**.  
In practice, the group-level variances $\tau_g^2$ are **learned from the data**, enabling the model to **adapt shrinkage across biological structures**.

---

--->

## Indicator Variables and Posterior Inclusion Probabilities

In Bayesian variable selection, each feature $j$ is assigned an **indicator variable**:

$$
\delta_j =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if feature $j$ has a non-zero effect} \\
0, & \text{if feature $j$ has no effect.}
\end{cases}
$$

<!---
The model can be written as:
$$
\beta_j = \alpha_j \, \delta_j, \qquad 
\alpha_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau^2), \quad
\delta_j \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi)
$$

where $\pi$ is the prior inclusion probability.  
--->

After inference, we estimate $\text{PIP}_j = P(\delta_j = 1 \mid \text{data})$ — the **posterior inclusion probability** for feature *j*.

## Summary of BLR Model Structures

<div style="font-size: 0.85em">

| **Model Type** | **Prior Structure** | **Biological Interpretation** |
|:----------------|:--------------------|:-------------------------------|
| **Single-component BLR** | One global variance $\tau^2$ | All features (across layers) share the same level of shrinkage — equal contribution assumption |
| **Multiple-component BLR** | Mixture of variances $\{\tau_k^2\}$ | Features belong to different effect-size classes (e.g., large, small, null); grouping learned from data |
| **Hierarchical (Biologically informed) BLR** | Group-specific **mixtures of variances** $\{\tau_{gk}^2\}$ | Features grouped *a priori* (e.g., by genes, pathways, or omic layers); within each group, effects can vary in size and sparsity |

</div>

These models form a hierarchy of increasing flexibility and biological realism —  
from **global shrinkage** → to **data-driven heterogeneity** → to **biologically structured mixtures** that model variation *within and between* feature sets.

---



## Motivation for Multivariate BLR

Many traits and molecular layers are **correlated** — they share genetic architecture and biological pathways.  

<br>

To model these dependencies, we extend BLR to the **multivariate** setting:

- **Jointly models multiple traits or omic layers**  
  → captures shared genetic or molecular effects  
- **Borrows strength across correlated traits**  
  → improves fine-mapping resolution and prediction accuracy  
- **Estimates cross-trait effect patterns**  
  → helps identify pleiotropic genes and shared biological pathways  

---

## The Multivariate Bayesian Linear Regression (MV-BLR) Model

In the **multivariate BLR** model, we model **multiple correlated outcomes** jointly:

$$
\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{E}
$$

- $\mathbf{Y}$: $(n \times T)$ matrix of outcomes  
  (e.g., association measures for $T$ traits or omic layers)  
- $\mathbf{X}$: $(n \times p)$ feature matrix  
- $\mathbf{B}$: $(p \times T)$ matrix of effect sizes  
- $\mathbf{E}$: $(n \times T)$ residual matrix  

Each row of $\mathbf{Y}$ corresponds to an observation or gene,  and each column to a trait, phenotype, or molecular layer.

---

## Multivariate Error and Effect Priors

We extend the univariate priors to the multivariate setting:

$$
\mathbf{e}_{i\cdot} \sim \mathcal{N}_T(\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e)
$$
$$
\mathbf{b}_j \sim \mathcal{N}_T(\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_b)
$$

- $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$: residual covariance among traits  
- $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_b$: covariance of effect sizes across traits  
- When $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$ and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_b$ are diagonal,  the model reduces to $T$ independent univariate BLR models.

Allows **information sharing across correlated traits or omic layers** and can be used to identify **pleiotropic effects** and **cross-trait genetic architectures**.



---

## Multivariate BLR (Structured MV-BLR)

The hierarchical structure can be extended to model **multiple traits**  
while preserving **biological grouping** of features:

$$
\mathbf{b}_j \sim \mathcal{N}_T\!\big(\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{b, g(j)}\big), \qquad
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{b, g} \sim p(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{b, g})
$$

- Each biological group $g$ has its own **trait-level covariance matrix** $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{b,g}$  
- $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{b,g}$ captures **correlations and scale of effects** across traits within that group  

Enables information sharing both **within biological sets** and **across correlated traits**.  


---

## Indicator Variables and PIPs (Multivariate BLR)

In the **multivariate BLR**, each feature $j$ may affect multiple outcomes (traits).  
We extend the indicator variable to capture **cross-trait activity patterns**:

$$
\boldsymbol{\delta}_j =
\begin{bmatrix}
\delta_{j1} \\ \delta_{j2} \\ \vdots \\ \delta_{jT}
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad
\delta_{jt} =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if feature $j$ affects trait $t$} \\
0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

After inference, we estimate $\text{PIP}_{jt} = P(\delta_{jt} = 1 \mid \text{data})$ —  the **posterior inclusion probability** that feature *j* affects trait *t*.

---

## Interpreting Posterior Inclusion Probabilities (PIPs)


- PIPs quantify the **probability that a feature is truly associated** with one or more outcomes.  
- High PIPs (e.g., > 0.9) indicate strong evidence for inclusion.
- A probabilistic view of how molecular variation drives outcomes
- Patterns in $\boldsymbol{\delta}_j$ reveal **shared vs. trait-specific effects** —  all zeros (no effect), few ones (trait-specific), many ones (shared or pleiotropic).

<div style="font-size: 0.75em">

| **Model Type** | **Feature Integration** | **Grouping Basis** | **Prior Structure** | **What It Captures** |
|:----------------|:------------------------|:-------------------|:--------------------|:---------------------|
| **Single-component BLR** | Combines all biological features in one model | None | One global variance ($\tau^2$) | All features contribute equally; uniform shrinkage |
| **Multiple-component BLR** | Integrates all layers but allows heterogeneous contributions | Learned from data | Mixture of variances ($\{\tau_k^2\}$) | Large, small, and null effect classes |
| **Hierarchical BLR** | Groups features by biological structure (e.g., genes, pathways) | Defined *a priori* | Group-specific **mixture of variances** ($\{\tau_{gk}^2\}$) | Within-group heterogeneity; enrichment and structured shrinkage |
| **Multivariate BLR** | Jointly models multiple correlated traits or outcomes | None or by trait | Shared covariance ($\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_b$) across traits | Genetic/molecular correlations; pleiotropy |
| **Hierarchical MV-BLR** | Combines biological grouping and multiple outcomes | Defined *a priori* | Group- and trait-specific covariance mixtures ($\{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{b,gk}\}$) | Shared biological mechanisms across traits and layers |

## Learning at Different Levels

<div style="font-size: 0.7em">

| **Model Level** | **Key Parameters Learned** | **What They Represent** | **How They Are Learned** | **What We Learn Biologically** |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------|:-------------------------|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| **Effect sizes** | $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ | Strength and direction of association for each feature | Posterior mean/median given priors and data | Which features drive the outcome |
| **Indicator variables** | $\delta_j$ (single trait), $\boldsymbol{\delta}_j$ (multi-trait) | Whether feature $j$ is active (and for which traits) | Estimated as posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) | Which features are relevant, and whether effects are shared or trait-specific |
| **Variance components** | $\tau^2$, $\{\tau_k^2\}$, $\{\tau_{gk}^2\}$ | Magnitude of expected effect sizes; heterogeneity across layers or groups | Inferred hierarchically from the data (via MCMC or EM) | How strongly different groups or omic layers contribute |
| **Covariance components** | $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_b$, $\{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{b,g}\}$ | Correlation of effects across traits or molecular layers | Estimated from joint posterior | Shared pathways, pleiotropy, and cross-layer architecture |

</div>

## Bayesian Linear Regression for Polygenic Risk Scoring

Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) provides a **probabilistic framework** for estimating genome-wide effects used in **polygenic risk scores (PRS)**.

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}, 
\qquad 
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \mathbf{I})
$$

After fitting the BLR model:

- Posterior means $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = E(\boldsymbol{\beta} \mid \text{data})$ represent **regularized SNP effect estimates**.  
- Individual-level PRS values are computed as:

$$
\text{PRS}_i = \sum_j X_{ij} \, \hat{\beta}_j
$$

---

## The *qgg* R Package

[**qgg**](https://github.com/psoerensen/qgg) provides tools for statistical modeling and analysis of large-scale genomic data, including:

- Fine-mapping of genomic regions using **Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) models**  
- Polygenic scoring using **Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) models**  
- Gene set enrichment analysis using **Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) models**  

*qgg* handles large-scale genomic data through **efficient algorithms** and **sparse matrix techniques**, combined with **multi-core processing** using **OpenMP**, **multithreaded matrix operations** via **BLAS** libraries (e.g., OpenBLAS, ATLAS, or MKL), and **fast, memory-efficient batch processing** of genotype data stored in  
binary formats such as **PLINK `.bed` files**.

# Posterior Summaries in Bayesian Hierarchical Models {.center-title}

---


## Understanding the Outputs of Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR)

The BLR model produces **posterior summaries** that describe  the evidence, magnitude, and uncertainty of feature effects.

Key outputs:

1. **Posterior means of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$** (effect sizes)  
2. **Posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs)**  
3. **Variance component estimates** ($\sigma^2$, $\tau^2$, …)

Each plays a distinct and complementary role in interpretation.

---

##  Posterior Means of Effect Sizes ($\boldsymbol{\beta}$)

- Represent the **estimated effect** of each feature (gene, SNP, or set)  
- Computed as posterior averages:  
  $$
  \hat{\beta}_j = \mathbb{E}[\beta_j \mid \mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X}]
  $$
- Interpretation:
  - Magnitude → **direction and strength** of association  
  - Sign → **positive or negative effect**  
  - Shrinkage → smaller estimates for weak or uncertain effects  

- These are directly analogous to regression coefficients,  but account for prior information and uncertainty.

---

##  Posterior Inclusion Probabilities (PIPs)

- Represent the **probability** that feature $j$ has a nonzero effect:
  $$
  \text{PIP}_j = \Pr(\beta_j \neq 0 \mid \mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X})
  $$

- Quantifies **evidence of inclusion** in the model:
  - High PIP → strong support for inclusion  
  - Low PIP → likely irrelevant or redundant feature  

- Interpretation:
  - PIPs act as **Bayesian significance measures**  
  - Useful for **ranking**, **fine-mapping**, and **feature prioritization**

In pathway analyses (e.g., Bayesian MAGMA), PIPs correspond to **gene- or set-level importance scores**.

---

## Variance Component Estimates ($\tau^2$, $\sigma^2$)

Variance components describe **uncertainty** and **heterogeneity** in effect sizes:

$$
\beta_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau^2)
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
$$

**$\tau^2$** is the variance component for the effect sizes  
- Small $\tau^2$: most effects are close to zero  
- Large $\tau^2$: more large-effect features expected  

**$\sigma^2$** is the variance component for the residuals  
- Captures unexplained variation after accounting for $\mathbf{X}$  

Together, these components describe the **genetic architecture**, enabling **heritability estimation**, **uncertainty quantification**, and **enrichment analysis** across sets or traits.

---

##  Interpreting the Outputs Together

| Quantity | Interpretation | Typical use |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| $\hat{\beta}_j$ | Direction and magnitude of effect | Effect estimation, prediction |
| $\text{PIP}_j$ | Probability feature is truly associated | Fine-mapping, feature ranking |
| $\tau^2$, $\sigma^2$ | Variance in effect sizes and residuals | Genetic architecture, model fit |

These summaries are **synergistic**:  

 - $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ tells *how much*  
 - PIP tells *how confident*  
 - Variance components tell *how complex*  

---

## Multivariate BLR Outputs

In the multivariate setting, we generalize each posterior quantity:

| Parameter | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| $\mathbf{B} = [\beta_{jt}]$ | Effect matrix across traits ($j$: feature, $t$: trait) |
| $\text{PIP}_j$ | Probability that feature $j$ affects ≥1 trait |
| $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_b$ | Covariance of effects across traits |
| $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$ | Residual covariance among traits |

These allow us to identify:

 - **Shared genetic effects** (pleiotropy)  
 - **Trait-specific vs. shared signals**  
 - **Cross-trait enrichment** of biological sets

---

# Estimating Variance Components in Bayesian Hierarchical Models {.center-title}

---

## Estimating Variance Components During Model Fitting

In Bayesian Linear Regression, the **variance components** are *not fixed* —  they are **estimated jointly** with the effect sizes $\boldsymbol{\beta}$.

- The model defines hierarchical priors:
  $$
  \beta_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau^2)
  \qquad \text{and} \qquad
  \varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
  $$
  where $\tau^2$ and $\sigma^2$ are **unknown parameters**.

- These variances are updated iteratively during MCMC or EM optimization:
  - **$\tau^2$** reflects the inferred spread of true effects  
  - **$\sigma^2$** reflects residual noise or unexplained variability  

Inference alternates between sampling (or updating) $\boldsymbol{\beta}$  and re-estimating the variance components given the data and current effects.

---

## Hierarchical Structure: Full Bayesian Estimation

Each variance component has its own prior, enabling uncertainty propagation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Y} &= \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}, & \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2\mathbf{I}) \\
\beta_j &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau^2) & \tau^2 \sim \text{Inv-}\chi^2(\nu_\tau, S_\tau^2) \\
\sigma^2 &\sim \text{Inv-}\chi^2(\nu_\sigma, S_\sigma^2)
\end{aligned}
$$

- The model integrates over the **uncertainty in $\tau^2$ and $\sigma^2$**,  
  not just point estimates  
- Posterior samples of these parameters describe:
  - The **degree of polygenicity** (via $\tau^2$)  
  - The **signal-to-noise ratio** (via $\tau^2 / \sigma^2$)

This full hierarchical treatment improves stability and interpretability  compared to fixing variance components a priori.

## In Grouped or Multi-Component BLR Models

Variance components can be **set-specific** or **mixture-specific**,  
and are all estimated from the data:

$$
\beta_j \sim \mathcal{N}\!\big(0, \tau_{g(j)}^2\big), \qquad
\tau_g^2 \sim p(\tau_g^2)
$$

or

$$
\beta_j \sim \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k\,\mathcal{N}(0, \tau_k^2), \qquad
\tau_k^2 \sim p(\tau_k^2)
$$

- Each $\tau_g^2$ (or $\tau_k^2$) is **estimated adaptively**  
- Groups or components with strong evidence receive **larger $\tau^2$**  
  (less shrinkage, more signal)  
- Noisy or irrelevant groups shrink toward **smaller $\tau^2$**  

Variance components act as *adaptive shrinkage parameters*, controlling model complexity based on the data.

---

## In the Multivariate BLR Model

Variance components generalize to covariance matrices:

$$
\mathbf{b}_j \sim \mathcal{N}_T(\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_b), \qquad
\mathbf{E}_{i\cdot} \sim \mathcal{N}_T(\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e)
$$

- $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_b$: covariance of effects across traits  
  → estimated from shared signal among outcomes  
- $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$: residual covariance among traits  
  → estimated from correlated noise or shared environment

Estimating $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_b$ and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_e$  enables discovery of **pleiotropy** and **cross-trait genetic structure**.

---

## Why Variance Component Estimation Matters

<div style="font-size: 0.8em">

| Parameter | Role | Interpretation |
|------------|------|----------------|
| $\tau^2$ | Effect-size variance | How much true genetic signal exists |
| $\sigma^2$ | Residual variance | How much variation remains unexplained |
| $\tau_g^2$ / $\tau_k^2$ | Group or component variance | Which sets/components are enriched |
| $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_b$ | Cross-trait covariance | Pleiotropy or shared mechanisms |

</div>

These variance components are not tuning parameters —  they are **learned quantities** that describe the underlying biology. Their estimation is central to the interpretability of BLR and *gact* analyses.

## Summary: Variance Components as Model-Driven Insights

- Estimated **jointly** with effect sizes and inclusion probabilities  
- Control the **degree of shrinkage and complexity** in the model  
- Reveal **biological structure** (e.g., gene-set enrichments, trait correlations)  
- Provide **model-based evidence** for:
  - Polygenicity  
  - Pleiotropy  
  - Biological pathway relevance  

In short, variance components are *learned descriptors of architecture*,  not just technical parameters — and are a cornerstone of *gact*’s BLR framework.

## Gene Set Analyses

Gene and biological pathway prioritization can provide valuable insights into the underlying biology of diseases and potential drug targets.

<br>

**MAGMA**: Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (Leuww et al 2015) generalized gene set analysis of GWAS data

- Compute gene-level association statistics (**$y$**)
- Create a design matrix based on annotation (**$X$**)

Compute gene-level (or other feature-level) association statistics:

- Account for correlation among marker statistics (i.e., linkage disequilibrium, LD)
- Different LD-adjustment methods (e.g., SVD, clumping and thresholding, BLR)
- The choice of method depends on the quality of the available GWAS summary statistics and LD reference panel

  - Enable **reproducible and extensible workflows** that accelerate biological discovery  

---

## Current Limitations of *gact*

While *gact* provides a solid infrastructure for integrative genomics, several limitations remain:

- **Data dependency and versioning**  
  - Relies on multiple external databases (e.g., Ensembl, GTEx, STRING) that are updated independently — requiring ongoing maintenance and version tracking.  

- **Missingness and bias in input data**  
  - GWAS summary statistics, biological annotations, and gene–set mappings may be incomplete, unevenly distributed across traits or populations, or biased toward well-studied genes and pathways.  

- **Limited multi-omic data integration**  
  - Primarily supports genomic and gene-level information; quantitative transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data are not yet integrated directly.  

- **Scalability and performance**  
  - The folder-based database and R-based workflow may become slow or memory-intensive for very large GWAS or fine-mapping datasets.  

- **Limited parallelization and cloud support**  
  - Most functions are optimized for local execution; distributed or cloud-based workflows (e.g., AWS, GCP, or HPC clusters) are not yet implemented.  

- **Annotation bias and incompleteness**  
  - Dependent on existing biological databases that vary in coverage and quality; missing or biased annotations can propagate into analyses and interpretations.  

- **Visualization and user interface**  
  - Lacks a graphical dashboard or web interface; currently requires R scripting for all operations and exploration.  


---

## Future Directions for *gact*

To address current limitations and expand functionality, upcoming development will focus on:

- **Improved data management and versioning**  
  - Automated tracking of database versions and metadata to ensure reproducibility across analyses.  

- **Handling missingness and bias**  
  - Implement QC pipelines for GWAS and annotation data, harmonize population-specific resources, and flag incomplete mappings.  

- **Expanded multi-omics integration**  
  - Incorporate quantitative transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic datasets to support integrative modeling.  

- **Enhanced scalability and performance**  
  - Optimize file I/O, adopt sparse data structures, and enable distributed computation for large-scale analyses.  

- **Cloud and HPC compatibility**  
  - Add support for parallel execution and storage on cloud or cluster environments (e.g., AWS, GCP, SLURM).  

- **Richer annotation ecosystem**  
  - Integrate additional databases and functional genomics resources to improve biological coverage and reduce bias.  

- **Visualization and user accessibility**  
  - Develop interactive dashboards and R Shiny tools for exploring associations, enrichment results, and model outputs.

## Learning at Different Levels

BLR models **learn hierarchically**:

- Inclusion indicators → *Which features matter*  
- Variance/covariance components → *How much they matter and how they relate across traits*  

Together, they enable **data-driven and biologically informed inference** across multiple levels.
