# Bayesian Linear Regression

**Author:** [Peter Sørensen](https://psoerensen.github.io/)  
**Affiliation:** Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics, Aarhus University  

---

This repository includes theoretical notes, slides, and hands-on R examples for exploring **Bayesian Linear Regression**.
It introduces both classical and Bayesian regression methods, showing how to estimate parameters, define priors, perform posterior inference via Gibbs sampling, and assess convergence - all through practical R code.
