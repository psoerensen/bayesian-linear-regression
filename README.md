# Classical and Bayesian Linear Regression

This repository contains theoretical notes, slides, and practical examples for learning and teaching **Bayesian Linear Regression** and related topics.  
It covers both classical and Bayesian approaches to regression, including model estimation, prior specification, Gibbs sampling, and convergence diagnostics.
