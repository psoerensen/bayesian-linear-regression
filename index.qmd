# Welcome  

This website provides theoretical notes, slides, and practical examples for learning and teaching **Bayesian Linear Regression** and related topics. The materials cover both classical and Bayesian approaches to regression, including model estimation, prior specification, Gibbs sampling, and convergence diagnostics.
