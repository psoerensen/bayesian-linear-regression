The following materials include theoretical notes, slides, and practical R examples for exploring **Bayesian Linear Regression**.
It introduces both classical and Bayesian regression methods, showing how to estimate parameters, define priors, perform posterior inference via Gibbs sampling, and assess convergence - all through practical R code.

Explore the sections below to find the corresponding materials.
