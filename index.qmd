# Classical and Bayesian Linear Regression

Welcome ??  

This site contains **Quarto documents** that demonstrate and compare different linear regression models — from the **classical ordinary least squares (OLS)** approach to **Bayesian models** with Gaussian and spike-and-slab priors.

Each document includes a short theoretical overview, commented R code, and visualizations of results and diagnostics.  
All examples are implemented in **pure base R**, so they can run anywhere R is installed.
